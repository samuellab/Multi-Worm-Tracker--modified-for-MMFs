This is a version of Rex Kerr's multi worm tracker that has been modified to read mmf files; compressed image stacks generated by Samuel lab software.  
Currently (12/8/2011), the Image-Stack-Compressor submodule is private to the Samuel lab.  It should become public in a week or so.
If you are looking for the multi-worm tracker, please vist Rex Kerr's lab webpage

or the sourceforge home of the MWT

This is a bastardized, unsupported version of the MWT.  Running it will likely cause your computer to turn evil and try to eat you.  So please get the official version from the sources above.
